//Retrieve sign in failures due to third party MFA (Okta/Duo etc). Azure AD handles third party MFA different to native MS MFA. A user is sent to the third party MFA service and generates code 50158.
//If successful the user then generates a success code 0. When third party MFA fails Azure AD logs the 50158 result code but no corresponding 0 result code.
