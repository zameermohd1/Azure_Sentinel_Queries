//Detect when a user has been potentially comrpomised but is stopped by MFA number matching or otherwise denied. Even if stopped by MFA the users credentials need to be rotated.

//Data connector required for this query - Azure Active Directory - Signin Logs

//This query finds any time a user denies an authentication, enters the wrong number or just doesn't respond three or more times in a single sign in event

//This is the same query but grouped by username and 10 minute period, in case the attacker is starting a new authentication flow and generates a new CorrelationId
